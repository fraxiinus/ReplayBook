title: Images Are Not Loading

![Example of issue](../images/troubleshooting/imagesNotLoading_example.png)

Check if you have any **static data bundles** downloaded. Bundles are required for ReplayBook to display images correctly.

Right click the replay that is having image issues, and click 「Get Images for Patch XX.XX」. ReplayBook will download the appropriate bundle and the images should now display properly.

If that does not fix the problem, try deleting the most recent bundle and then re-download it.
