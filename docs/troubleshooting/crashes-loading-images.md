# ReplayBook Launches, But Crashes When Loading Thumbnails

Check if you have some kind of ransomware protection enabled on your system. That feature prevents unauthorized applications from saving files in certain folders.

You can get around this by keeping ReplayBook in a folder that is not restricted, or adding ReplayBook as an allowed app in the ransomware protection settings.
