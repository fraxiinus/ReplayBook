**There is no known method of fixing replays that are in this state.**

The replay file is missing the entire data block that ReplayBook relies on for information. The replay is still playable, however previews and [the exporter](../getting-started/exporting-player-data.md) will not be able to get any data.

![Example of problem](../images/troubleshooting/replayNotShowingData_1.bmp)

So far all examples of this have been replays from the **Tournament Realm**.
