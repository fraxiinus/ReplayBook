# ReplayBook is Not Loading Replays

Make sure you have your replay folder added to ReplayBook. Otherwise the the program won't know where to look.

!!! note
    The default location for replays is "C:\Users\username\Documents\League of Legends\Replays".

## How to add a replay folder

1. Go to "Settings" (gear icon) -> "Replays" -> "Add" button under "Replay Source Folders".
2. Close the settings window and ReplayBook will search your newly added folder.
