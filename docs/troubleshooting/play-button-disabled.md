# Play Button is Disabled

Make sure you have registered your installation(s) of League of Legends with ReplayBook. In order to play a replay from an old patch, you need a copy of that exact patch on your computer. If you do not have a backup, try looking for a download online, or from someone you know.

!!! warning
    Double check if you really have a patch. In the "Registered Executables" list, each item has the name on the left and the patch on the right. You might have a situation where the executable is named "Patch 10.22" but the actual patch version is something else.
