# Setting Up ReplayBook

## First Time Setup

The first time you launch ReplayBook, you will be greeted with the **Welcome Setup Window**. Choose your preferred language and click **Next**.

In this screen, select where you installed League of Legends. This is what allows ReplayBook to play replays. The default location for the Riot Games folder would be something like "C:\Riot Games".

!!! note

    If nothing shows up in the **Detected versions** box, double check to make sure you selected the correct folder.
    If you have a backup folder with multiple installations, the screen will search and add all detected versions.

Continue to the next step when ready.

Click the **Browse** button and select where replays are saved on your computer. The default folder used by the League of Legends client would be something like "C:\Users\username\Documents\League of Legends\Replays"

You can always add more replay folders later.

You can choose to download all image assets now. This improves performance, but takes a few minutes, even with fast internet. If you choose to skip this step, ReplayBook will download images when it needs them, much like a web browser.

That is it! With that, the basic setup for ReplayBook is complete. Click **Finish** and ReplayBook will open.

!!! note
    If you ever need to repeat this setup process, delete the file "ReplayBook\cache\SKIPWELCOME".

## How to Associate .ROFL Files with ReplayBook

By default, you need to manually enable .ROFL file associations.

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon) -> **General** page
2. Click the **Set .ROFL file association** button
3. Verify the association by double-clicking a .ROFL file in Explorer

!!! note
    You can also choose the default behavior for opening .ROFL files in Explorer. ReplayBook can either play the replay immediately, or show the replay's information.
