ReplayBook utilizes [Lucene.NET](https://lucenenet.apache.org/) for its search functionality.
The full query syntax can be found [here](https://lucenenet.apache.org/docs/4.8.0-beta00016/api/queryparser/Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Classic.html).

## Example Queries

### Query player and champion

```plaintext
"wifienyabledcat Yuumi"
```

The quotes ensure that only replays where `wifienyabledcat` is playing `Yuumi` are returned.

Use the `AND` operator to query two players:

```plaintext
"wifienyabledcat Nami" AND Shavisi
```

And to specify champions:

```plaintext
"wifienyabledcat Yuumi" AND "Shavisi Zeri"
```

### Query matchups

Look for replays that have Nami against Senna:

```plaintext
(blue:Nami AND red:Senna) OR (red:Nami AND blue:Senna)
```

Player names can also be specified:

```plaintext
(blue:"Shavisi Nami" AND red:Senna) OR (red:"Shavisi Nami" AND blue:Senna)
```

Search only player matchups:

```plaintext
(blue:Shavisi AND red:Etirps) OR (red:Shavisi AND blue:Etirps)
```

### Range Queries

Fields can be queried over a range, this example returns all replays between the dates 2023-04-01 and 2023-04-29:

```plaintext
date:[20230401 TO 20230429]
```

Only return replays with a length between 10 minutes and 20 minutes:

```plaintext
length:[1000 TO 2000]
```

These of course can be combined with other queries, this example returns replays where wifienyabledcat is playing Milio in the month of April:

```plaintext
"wifienyabledcat milio" AND date:[20230401 TO 20230431]
```

## Search Strictness

Search results are filtered by a score determined by how well it matches the query.
This filter can be adjusted to a lower value if the results are being constrained, or to a higher value if non-relevant results are returning.
The default value is 0.3.
